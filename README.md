# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Import math into the program
### Step 2: Input the co-ordinates to calculate the distance between them
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![](formula.JPGs)
### Step 4: Print the programm
### Step 5: End the programm
### PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```


### OUTPUT:
